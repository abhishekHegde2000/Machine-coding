### 6 - Create a React component called WeatherWidget to display weather information

**Topic:** React, TypeScript, API Integration

**Task:**
Create a React component called `WeatherWidget` to display weather information.

**Requirements:**

-   The component should accept a prop called `location` of type `string` representing the location for which weather information will be displayed.
-   Fetch weather data from a weather API (you can use any public weather API, like OpenWeatherMap).
-   Display the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), temperature, and wind speed for the specified location.
-   Use TypeScript for type safety.

**Example:**

```tsx
<WeatherWidget location="New York" />
```

Output:

```
(Weather data fetched from the API for New York)
Current Weather: Sunny
Temperature: 72Â°F
Wind Speed: 5 mph
```

**Solution:** (To be implemented by you!)
