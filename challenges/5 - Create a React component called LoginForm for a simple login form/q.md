### 5 - Create a React component called LoginForm for a simple login form.

**Task:**
Create a React component called `LoginForm` for a simple login form.

**Requirements:**

-   The component should have state to store the user's input for username and password.
-   The form should have input fields for username and password.
-   The component should have a submit button.

Password: password
```
