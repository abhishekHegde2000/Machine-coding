30 Javascript questions I find very useful in the Interviews.

The patterns in these questions will prep you end-to-end for Interviews and solidify your core concepts.

Save it & thank me later :)

‚û°Ô∏è First Technical Round
Initially they asked about my previous experience and project overview what I am currently working on, then technical things started.

1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML/CSS questions: provided a web page and asked me to tell whatever I see on the page in terms of HTML and CSS elements/attributes.
He asked about sematic tags, box model, flex-box, grid, navbar arrangement, there was a form in the page, few questions about input elements and its attributes.
2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference b/w promise and async/await?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Asked to write one async/await function and some questions related to it (how things will work when we use await, can we use await keyword outside async function)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Asked about ES-6 feature - array and object de-structuring then asked to write one sample object de-structuring
5Ô∏è‚É£ Sample JavaScript code: Output based question
let x = 10;
let y = x++;
console.log(x); console.log(y);

6Ô∏è‚É£ In React - what is the use of useCallback and useMemo hook?
7Ô∏è‚É£ What are the different ways to improve React application?
8Ô∏è‚É£ He sked me to create simple page in React (parent and child component)
‚ûñ Parent component ‚ûñ

- It has one input filed and a button
- Enter any book name and click the button
- It should pass the details to child component as a prop
  ‚ûñ Child component ‚ûñ
- It receives the props
- It should be displayed in tabular format and serial number should be added and should be increased automatically.

Examples:
